## **One Course 一门课**

Stanford CS107e: Computer Systems from the Ground Up
[http://cs107e.github.io/](http://cs107e.github.io/)

Yet another course covering subset of CSAPP, but you program on Raspberry Pi.

CS107E runs bare-metal (no OS or libraries) on a Raspberry PI ARM architecture.

It's a small course which is an alternative to "standard" CS107.

Students work in pairs when they participate the lab session.

这又是又一门“计算机系统导论”课, 但是在树莓派上编程。你会在一个没有操作系统的树莓派裸机上干活，直面硬件。

这是一个小班课，可以用于替代标准的CS107. 作业分为assignment和lab，区别在于lab可以在对应的实验课去实验室在助教指导下完成，assignment没有对应的统一实验课。另外，在实验课中学生结对完成实验。

[LAB3 Debugging and Testing](http://cs107e.github.io/labs/lab3/)对于调试相关的教学值得参考。

## **One Assignment 一项作业**

Stanford CS107 Computer Organization & Systems

[LAB7 Part II: Ethics Case Study of Therac-25](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs107/cs107.1236/lab7/)

It's an attempt to incorporate ethics into engineering course. Students discuss the stakes of bugs in critical medical devices. 

尝试在一门计算机专业课程中加入一些关于伦理的探讨：我们课上讲到的bug，在真实世界里会造成什么样的后果？也是一种“课程思政”。

## **One Paper 一篇论文**


Randy Pausch. 2008. Alice: a dying man's passion. In Proceedings of the 39th SIGCSE technical symposium on Computer science education (SIGCSE '08).

??? note "Read the Abstract 阅读摘要"
    I have spent the last fifteen years of my life leading an incredible team. Our quest (which we did not even realize in the beginning) was to revolutionize the way computer programming is taught. Current versions of the Alice system (Alice v2.0, and Caitlin Kelleher's "Storytelling Alice") have been very effective in the college classroom and in tests with middle school girls. The use of drag-and-drop authoring to create 3D movies has proved to be a powerful motivator for students of all ages and both genders. In 2008, we will release Alice v3.0, which provides "real Java" programming and the characters from EA's "The Sims," the most popular PC video game in history.

    Damn shame I won't be there to see it. As you probably know, I'm dying of pancreatic cancer, as became widely known in my "Last Lecture." Like Moses, I get to see the promised land, but not set foot in it. But the vision is clear. Long before I became ill, Dennis Cosgrove took over the responsibility for the design of Alice v3.0, and he's doing a whale of a job. Steve Cooper (of St. Joseph's University), Wanda Dann, and Don Slater are handling the pedagogic materials for college and high school, and Caitlin Kelleher (now junior faculty at Washington University in St. Louis) is heading the efforts regarding middle school girls.

    This talk will address the history, philosophy, and future of the Alice project, and will include a behind-the-scenes look at a pre-release version of Alice v3.0. I will give this address in person if I am still alive and able, or by a combination of pre-taped video and help from the Alice team. I cannot imagine a better professional legacy than what the Alice team is currently building.

It's actually not a paper but an abstract for a SIGCSE 08 keynote, introducing Alice Project which enables students to learn programming through making movies.

Randy Pausch died of pancreatic cancer. His "last lecture" recording is worth watching.

https://www.alice.org/ is the website of Alice project.

这严格来说不是一篇论文，而是SIGCSE 08的一个演讲的摘要, 介绍Alice项目，希望学生通过学习制作动画来学习编程。

如“dying man”所提到的，演讲者Randy Pausch因为胰腺癌去世， 他的“last lecture"录像网上容易找到，值得一看。
