# 计算机系助教培训 Teaching Assistants Competency

Most of the materials are in Chinese originally and we are trying to prepare the English version.

If you have questions about some of the materials, please email liurd22@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn

The structure of this site has changed a few times and we hope to show the iterations of our training program.

Here is an introduction of the current structure of this site:

[助教周刊 TA's Weekly](https://thucstac.github.io/TAC/weekly/) is an attempt to show "one course, one assignment, one paper" for TAs, which is discontinued after we find it hard to collect public materials which are inspiring for TAs.

[参考资料 Reference](https://thucstac.github.io/TAC/reference/) contains the third-party materials (URLs to them) we find useful for CS TA trainers.

[2023 Autumn](https://thucstac.github.io/TAC/textbook/) and [2024 Spring](https://thucstac.github.io/TAC/2024S/) are separately organized. We are feeling that it is not the best way to organize materials, especially if one session do not differ greatly from the prior semester.

We are trying to organize materials by topics. For each semester, one page should be enough for the summary and reflection of this semester.
